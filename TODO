add support for .ignore
this should stop the file update tracking for files / folders that match the info on each line of this file
I'd say we get all .ignore files in the config and plugin folders respectively and then make the code detect when a restricted file or folder is throwing an event, then reject the event and proceed
.ignore files should automatically be synced and should probably always be read first before processing a new file event
one other way to do it would be if an event occurs check the folder that file is in to see if its restricted, if so ignore

better way to do it:
1:
if the folder that contains the file that had an event is not the root folder of config or pluginconfig then check the upper folder for a .ignore file and check to see if that folder the event came from is restricted, if so ignore
